# Loadouts

Collection of opinioated software blueprints that are: 

- **ready** (iE: in hackathons or creative meetings)
- **stable** (tried-and-true components/techniques, but not latest versions needed)
- **complete** (always contain "useless" code to make copy/paste/modify loops faster)
- **deliverable** (at least one CI pipeline is already included)

## Motivation

I have to deal with a severe lack of discipline personally, and every time I have a great idea I spend the first days with setting up a project including deployments, testrunners, and so on - leaving me with only minimal motivation to implement the actual idea. 

Therefore, these software loadouts are pre-assembled and tuned for immediate use, and contain hard-won experiences from over a decade in web development. Clone it, boot it, ship it, ideally in less than a day.
